          Janet Kent is an herbalist and teacher who runs Terra Sylva School of
          Botanical Medicine with her husband Dave Meesters. Janet initially
          discovered herbalism because she moved off-the-grid around
          twenty-three years ago with her husband. Living thousands of feet
          above sea level in Marshall, North Carolina with a desire to connect
          to the history of the land, they began to use medicine as a community
          tool, integrating into the Appalachian community around them. Before
          moving onto this land, Janet said that she had no connection to
          herbalism; although she was fond of the plants themselves, the
          motivation to begin practicing lied in her desire to connect to her
          Appalachian community.

          When speaking about her practice, Janet made it clear that she views
          health through a societal context; in her class, she focuses on the
          politics of medicine, emphasizing the influence of capitalism on
          medicine.

          One plant that has influenced Janet’s herbalist practice is Angelica
          Triquinata. This native Appalachian plant grows on mountain balds and
          is used for digestion, circulatory benefits, asthma, and menstrual
          cramps. Janet, who is asthmatic, is particularly fond of this plant
          for many reasons, one of them being its ability to help with both
          breathing and digestion. She is particularly interested in the
          connection between breathing and digestion, holding an interest in the
          integration of the body parts and being able to access all of the
          parts of yourself.
        </p>
        <br />

          Janet explained Angelica as the “earth and the sky in one plant”
          because it has both strong, celestial influence as a protective plant,
          as well as practical and medicinal uses for physical bodies. Because
          this plant occupies these two worlds, Janet finds it grounding. She
          believes there is no higher self, there is just the need to integrate
          all of the selves that live in the overworld, underworld, and
          middleworld. Angelica helps Janet integrate the parts of herself. When
          the plant came into her life, it was growing abundantly around her
          house. Her friend mentioned it was meant for her to use in some way.
          Skeptical but curious, Janet tried it, and it ended up helping her
          asthma, keeping her lungs healthy and in place.
