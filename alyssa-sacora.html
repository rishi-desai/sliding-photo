          Alyssa’s formal interview portion came to me later through email, as I
          already spent weeks with her developing my project idea and did not
          have my fully developed questions ready.

          Alyssa’s plant is Common Milkweed (Asclepias syriaca). Alyssa chose
          this plant after we had made paper together, so as a result, she was
          not necessarily thinking about medicine, but thinking about how to
          work with the plant's fiber. She chose milkweed because of her
          appreciation for its aesthetic, scent, and ability to be food for both
          humans and insects. Alyssa described her developing relationship over
          the years with milkweed as a medicine in itself— “a balm for my heart,
          to tend to the separateness from the natural world that humans
          experience as a result of colonialism and capitalism.” The Common
          Milkweed grows throughout the country, allowing her to ground herself
          with the help of her “familiar friend” wherever she is when her mind
          and body become separated.

          She wants others to experience the practice of taking notice when they
          recognize the plant— “To notice how its runners pop up across the
          ground, how it milks, how the flowers are beautifully symmetrical and
          fragrant, how when a caterpillar is chomping its way through the
          leaves, we can appreciate the bite marks rather than destroy the
          caterpillar that is causing “damage,” how the seed pods develop over
          time, how the fibers can be twisted to make rope, how the seed fluff
          catches in the wind.” The practice of slowing down and being intune
          with the properties of the plant is important to Alyssa— with her
          desire to bridge humans and the natural world, Alyssa is committed to
          planting native plants that feed into the cycle of the food web— as
          the native plant, milkweed, offers food and shelter for many insects.
