          Joe Hollis founded Mountain Gardens around 50 years ago. Mountain
          Gardens is a botanical sanctuary, bordered by the National Forest and
          sheltered beneath the Black Mountains in North Carolina. Encompassing
          four acres, the sanctuary hosts an array of medicinal herbs and edible
          plants from across the globe. For the past fifty years, Joe has
          gathered valuable plants through trades with botanical gardens,
          gardeners, and seed-saving/sharing organizations. He estimates a
          collection of over a thousand plant species, including indigenous
          medicinal and edible varieties he has nurtured in the neighboring
          forests.

          Here is an account of the interaction with Joe Hollis I wrote directly
          after the interview:

        <p style="margin-left: 25px; text-indent: 0; font-style: italic">
          “I walked up a pathway from the dirt road. Traveled through the sticks
          and stones past huts and messes of plants, wood, and gardening
          materials. Piles indicative of the ever changing nature of this place.
          I migrated towards the voices in the distance. The dogs met me first.
          Greeting me as a friend rather than a stranger with the 1000 barks of
          terror, they led me to people. The people greeted me with tea, smiles,
          and curiosity. Their eyes lit up when I told them I was meeting with
          Joe. Joe was just waking when I had arrived fifteen minutes before our
          10am scheduled interview. His health is deteriorating and his staff
          were discussing his never ending dry mouth. They eventually led me to
          his home. More piles. Books, papers, plants, tinctures, books, more
          books, firewood, building wood, medicine, tobacco. They led me through
          the home to him. He was smaller than I expected, the couch he sat in
          swallowed him. He sat smoking a pipe. Life drained from his presence,
          from his eyes. What he shared always came back to Daoism. Interested
          in the balance between humans and nature. After the interview, his
          staff apologized for his health and not properly warning me of his
          scattered brain— he has cancer.”

          Joe Hollis passed away about one month after this interview. Joe’s
          plant is Jiao gu lan (Gynostemma pentaphyllum). This plant belongs to
          the squash family and has a reputation for being invasive. Joe brought
          this plant into the country from Japan in 1975. He explained the
          unique properties of Jiao gu lan being similar to Ginseng, which is
          heavily endangered in the United States. Jiao gu lan has Dammarane
          triterpene ginsenosides. Ginsenosides, which are found in ginseng,
          possess various health benefits such as anti-aging, anti-oxidative,
          anti-cancerous, etc. Jiao gu lan grows wild in China, and the leaves
          are used for medicine. It sometimes is referred to as “Southern
          Ginseng” because it grows in south central China. Jiao gu lan is used
          for high cholesterol, blood pressure, improved heart function,
          strengthened immune systems, and more. The two properties of the plant
          that Joe stressed were its adaptogens and ability to aid in longevity.
          Adaptogens are herbs, roots, and other plant substances that help our
          bodies manage stress and restore balance after a stressful situation.
          The idea of balance is significant to Joe, who has been practicing
          Daoism for over fifty years. When describing his devotion to Daoism,
          Joe began with the question: “Do we live in relation to nature or
          society?” Joe believes that we should live in relationship with nature
          rather than society.

          When asking about the development of his garden, Joe spoke in terms of
          being a “co-creator” of the land. He never planned too far in advance
          for his garden, as he did not want his own ego to play a role in its
          development. When he worked in the garden, he slowed, making sure
          everything was done by hand, to “impart intention” on the plants. The
          intention of his garden was to achieve perfect chi. Joe wanted to
          cultivate a space for writing poetry, playing, painting, and spiritual
          uplifting. Balance held the land together, with plants and humans
          working together; without this balance of the land, no balance could
          exist in the medicines, often in the form of tonics, that he was
          making. These tonics help to achieve an internal sense of balance,
          physically and mentally, in humans. These four steps aiming towards
          balance, cultivate a reciprocal relationship between humans and the
          land.
