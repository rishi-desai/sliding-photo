        <h1>MARC | DANDELION</h1>

          My project ultimately began and ended with Marc Williams. He was the
          first herbalist I spoke with and pointed me in the direction of other
          herbalists and artists that I engaged with. I met Marc for our
          interview at Mountain Gardens— He chose the dandelion as his plant.
          The dandelion flower leaves are used to stimulate digestion and
          appetite. Herbalists also use the dandelion root to detoxify the liver
          and gallbladder. Although the dandelion is used for its medicinal
          properties in herbalist communities, Marc mostly spoke to the plant's
          youthful symbolism and how that influences his practice. He wishes to
          make the practice of herbalism and sustainable eating accessible to
          the world. Marc was initially inspired to explore herbalism after a
          ten-day meditation retreat where he experienced a revelation— he
          needed to know where all of his food was coming from. His practice of
          herbalism continues through his desire to eat the plants, he said, “if
          you weed it you eat it.” Marc also expressed his love for turning a
          problem— an invasive plant like the dandelion— into a resource. He
          stated, the dandelion is a “multivitamin growing wild and free.”

          Marc described himself as in between the worlds of off-the-grid
          herbalism and higher education spaces. He serves as the communicator
          between the two— it figures that he was the first herbalist I met
          given this information. Marc’s love for the dandelion is driven by its
          accessibility and symbolic nature of youth and magic. The invasive
          nature of the dandelion along with its unique flower have made the
          plant so common that it is easily identifiable, even at a young age.
          This identifiability allows the plant to be more accessible to people.
          Marc often uses this plant to introduce others to herbalism as he
          finds that it is easier for people to wrap their heads around its
          medicinal properties.

          Despite the dandelion's accessible nature, Marc continues to find
          himself humbled by the dandelion’s breadth of healing properties— you
          think that you know it but there is always another path to take when
          making medicine that may give you unexpected discoveries about the
          plant.
