          After my interview with Janet Kent, I spoke with her husband, Dave
          Meesters. He started off our interview telling me about his practice
          and the reasons why he was initially drawn to herbalism. One, he
          described as the influence of the “punk DIY” scene and the other, as
          the “poison path.” In the eighties, Dave spent a lot of time traveling
          around the country, couch-hopping. He was inspired by the hospitality
          people showed him over the years and wanted to find a way to support
          his community in a capitalist environment that “doesn’t teach care.”
          The “poison path” influence towards herbalism began with his use of
          Poppies for opium. Although this plant influenced his initial interest
          in using plants for medicinal purposes, this was not the plant he
          wanted to discuss.

          When Dave moved to his current home with Janet and found an abundance
          of medicinal plants, similar to his wife, he started to make herbal
          medicine. Dave chose the plant Sochan (Rudbeckia Laciniata) as the
          plant that influenced his sustained practice of herbalism. For Dave,
          Sochan represents discovery. As a common underappreciated plant,
          Sochan is similar to the common medicinal plant, echinacea, yet more
          mild. To use the Sochan plant for medicine, the roots are the common
          part that is harvested and then the leaves are often eaten; however,
          plants can be used in a variety of ways for medicinal purposes, and
          Dave’s excitement for herbalism is just that: he is inspired by the
          endless possibilities of plants.

          Sochan, Dave described as an active, prompt, and mild plant, that you
          can use daily to get things moving correctly within your body. Similar
          to his wife, integration of all body parts is integral to maintain a
          healthy body and spirit. Dave wanted to stress the importance of body
          maintenance because we have lost self-care in capitalism. Herbs are
          not just for when you are sick.
